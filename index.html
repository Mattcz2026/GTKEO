			<h2>Introduction: I'm currently a Senior at Lewis University with a major in English and a concertation in writing. I personally love to do a bunch ofstuff in my free time whenever I am not working such as draw, listen to music, and play video games to name a few. I currently work at Menards and have been there for close to three years coming up in May. My family consists of my Mom, Dad, and three sisters along with me. Two older ones and a younger sister making things rough when it comes to family events.</h2>
